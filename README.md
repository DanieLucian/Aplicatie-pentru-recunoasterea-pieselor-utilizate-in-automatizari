DeTecht - Mobile application for recognizing parts used in automation

Uses machine learning algorithms and neural networks to identify devices in the field of automation and electronics (development boards, sensors, etc). 
Once the product is identified, relevant information will be extracted from the database: a general description, informative videos played in an integrated YoutTube player and links to websites where they can be purchased in order to reduce search time and risk of buying from untrustworthy sources.

The user can snap a photo of the device for identification or select an image from the gallery. Also, all scans are saved in a history, and the user has the option to delete a scan by swiping or all at the touch of a button

Technologies:
  - Android Studio IDE
  - MobileNet (convolutional neural network)
  - Keras (ML model creation and training)
  - Jetpack Compose (Kotlin-based UI)
  - Room Database (database desgin with Kotlin)
  - MVVM architecture
